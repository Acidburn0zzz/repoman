        "Description": "server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language (meta-package) This package is a meta-package that, when installed, guarantees that you have at least one of the four server-side versions of the PHP5 interpreter installed.  Removing this package won't remove PHP5 from your system, however it may remove other packages that depend on this one. . PHP5 is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly. . Homepage: http://www.php.net/",
